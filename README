    This "thing" was spawned by a comment at NODE 2010 in Frankfurt
    where someone said that the graphical quality of VVVV projects
    is naturally higher than that of many W-C-R* environments since it
    allows to fine tune variables on the fly without any additional effort.
    
    Although i'm not totally dacor with the conclusion i have to agree
    that adjusting variables can be painful even with such brilliant
    initiatives as controlP5** around.
    
    Another feature that VVVV has that we'd want for our beloved
    environment called Processing is that thing named "Herr Inspektor"***
    which is a get / set and information window for any node in a patch.
    Sort of a programmers multimeter.
    
    So, Tweeker will be a first attempt at creating an "adjust anything"
    interface and a "peek into what's happening" tool.

    Ideas ..
    
    – general information on the running sketch (fps, ...)
    – filter by type / name
    – tree like view to go into objects (sketch is root)
    
    ToDo ..
    
    – save, load from file, see problems
    
    Problems ..
    
    – drawn into main PGraphics: thread, speed, interaction,
      image ops, saveFrame, ..
    – set vals only remain while running. add save-load will cause
      projects to have to include tweeker into the distro like
      a library
